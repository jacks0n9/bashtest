				   ----
builtins/common.c
	- display_signal_list: if 0 is supplied as an argument to kill -l,
	  display a signal-out-of-range error.  Fixes bug reported by
	  Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

				   9/18
				   ----
print_cmd.c
	- print_heredoc_bodies: take a list of redirections, all here documents,
	  and print the here-document bodies including the ending delimiter,
	  followed by a newline
	- print_redirection_list: print the heredoc headers the first time
	  through the list of redirections so we print them in the same left-
	  to-right order they're supplied; print the bodies and delimiters with
	  print_heredoc_bodies after we print all the redirections if we're
	  not printing a list of commands (printing_connection == 0).  Fix for
	  problem reported by Isabella Parakiss <izaberina@gmail.com>
	- print_deferred_heredocs: don't print heredoc headers, since they're
	  now printed in print_redirection_list
	- print_deferred_heredocs: use print_heredoc_bodies

				   9/20
				   ----
builtins/mapfile.def
	- readarray: update usage synopsis to include -d delim.  Report and
	  fix from jhankins@homewood.k12.al.us

test.c
	- test_binop: if op[0] == '-', make sure op[1] != 0 before checking
	  op[2] or op[3].  Fixes out-of-bounds read reported by Franco
	  Costantini <franco.costantini.20@gmail.com>

parse.y
	- cond_term: if yylval.word->word[0] == '-' make sure word[1] != 0
	  before checking word[2] and calling test_unop.  Fixes out-of-bounds
	  read reported by Franco Costantini <franco.costantini.20@gmail.com>
	- make sure to check all instances of the return value of the
	  simple_command production before trying to hook redirections onto it,
	  since it can potentially return NULL.
	  Reported by Franco Costantini <franco.costantini.20@gmail.com>

				   9/21
				   ----
parse.y
	- token_is_assignment: make sure to check that the return value from
	  assignment() finds the `=' we just added at index I to avoid false
	  positives from g=g=g=g=g=g=().  Reported by Franco Costantini
	  <franco.costantini.20@gmail.com>

				   9/22
				   ----
parse.y
	- token_is_assignment: if we're not using the bash malloc (which has
	  guard bytes after the requested allocation size), use a new
	  buffer so we can make sure it's big enough to hold the current
	  token and at least two additional characters.  Reported by
	  Franco Costantini <franco.costantini.20@gmail.com>

				   9/23
				   ----
execute_command.c
	- execute_in_subshell: call without_job_control for both job control
	  and non-job-control builds to avoid waiting for last_made_pid
	  inherited from parent shell.  Related to fix from 8/4 to
	  initialize_subshell.  Fixes bug reported by Martijn Dekker
	  <martijn@inlv.org>

builtins/declare.def
	- local_builtin: allow `local --help' to work even when not executing
	  a function. Suggestion from Norm Abramovitz <norm@starkandwayne.com>

				   9/25
				   ----
builtins/printf.def
	- bexpand: if passed a null or empty string, return a newly-allocated
	  empty string (so the return value can always be freed) instead of
	  NULL.
	- printstr: if passed a null string, treat it as if it were an empty
	  string so any precision or fieldwidth arguments are handled
	  correctly.  Report from isabella parakiss <izaberina@gmail.com>

subst.c
	- skip_matched_pair: make the flags argument of 1 affect whether or
	  not backslash can quote characters in the string, so it affects
	  all quoting mechanisms

arrayfunc.c
	- unbind_array_element: now takes a third (flags) argument; flags&1
	  means to not expand an associative array index. This is only called
	  from a shell builtin context, which means the argument should have
	  already undergone word expansion, so it should be ok.  Will still
	  be a problem for uses like "unset -v 'var[$ind]'", quoted to avoid
	  globbing
	- valid_array_reference: pass second flags argument to skipsubscript;
	  still set to 0 by all callers

arrayfunc.h
	- unbind_array_element: updated prototype

builtins/set.def
	- unset_builtin: add third argument of 1 to unbind_array_element calls
	  [TEMPORARILY DISABLED]
	- unset_builtin: call valid_array_reference with second arg of 1 to
	  handle unmatched pairs of quotes and [/]

array.c
	- array_reference: optimize access locality as well as sequential
	  access by adding ability to start from last-accessed element and move
	  backwards or forwards depending on the desired index.  Inspired by
	  report from Tom McCurdy <tom.j.mccurdy@gmail.com> and followup from
	  Christian Franke <Christian.Franke@t-online.de>

variables.c
	- all_array_variables: include associative arrays, not just indexed
	  arrays.  Reported by Grisha Levit <grishalevit@gmail.com>

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_disk_command: if we're optimizing out the fork (CMD_NO_FORK),
	  decrement the shell level so we don't end up incrementing it twice.
	  We should decrement the shell level for an implicit exec like an
	  explicit one.  Reported by Stephane Chazelas
	  <stephane.chazelas@gmail.com>

builtins/exec.def
	- exec_builtin: don't bother to decrement the shell level if we are
	  already in a `(command)' subshell.  Reported by Stephane Chazelas
	  <stephane.chazelas@gmail.com>

lib/readline/macro.c
	- macro_level: count of macro nesting level, maintained by
	  _rl_push_executing_macro and _rl_pop_executing macro
	- _rl_with_macro_input: if current nesting level exceeds
	  MAX_MACRO_LEVEL, abort the current command line with _rl_abort_internal
	  and return to the top level.  Reported by Christian Klomp
	  <christianklomp@gmail.com>

lib/readine/history.c
	- add_history: if allocating the history list for the first time,
	  make sure the max history list size isn't so large that it will
	  cause allocation errors.  Cap it at MAX_HISTORY_INITIAL_SIZE
	  (8192).  Reported by Sean Zha <freeman_cha@hotmail.com>

jobs.c
	- wait_for: if a foreground job with job control enabled is killed by a
	  SIGINT and sourcelevel != 0, act as if we received the SIGINT so the
	  file sourcing can be terminated.  Reported by PePa
	  <peterkelly@passchier.net>

				   9/26
				   ----
subst.c
	- read_comsub: only warn once for null bytes in command substitution
	  output, instead of once for every null byte

arrayfunc.c
	- array_variable_part: now takes a `flags' argument; changed all callers
	  to initially pass 0
	- array_variable_name: now takes a `flags' argument; changed all callers
	  to initially pass 0
	- array_variable_name: pass `flags' argument to skipsubscript instead
	  of just passing 0

arrayfunc.h
	- array_variable_{name,part}: added new argument to prototypes

				   9/29
				   ----
bashline.c
	- bash_directory_completion_hook: don't bother to try and expand a
	  ${ or $( that isn't complete; expand_prompt_string will complain.
	  Fixes reports from John Passaro <john.a.passaro@gmail.com> and
	  Valentin Bajrami <valentin.bajrami@gmail.com>

lib/readline/history.c
	- _hs_append_history_line: use a strategy that attempts to avoid
	  realloc copying memory to a newly-allocated block if the history
	  line we're appending to gets `too long' (currently 256 bytes).
	  We reallocate in powers of 2 starting at 512, and rely on realloc
	  not allocating a new block and copying into it if the size is the
	  same as the last call to realloc.  Addresses issue raised by
	  Hubert Schmid <h.schmid@gmx.de>

trap.h
	- check_signals: new extern declaration
	- trapped_signal_received: new extern declaration

builtins/read.def
	- read_builtin: if one of the zread* functions returns < 0 (which
	  usually only happens in Posix mode), make sure we call check_signals()
	  before eventually calling run_pending_traps() because zread() isn't
	  going to call it
	- include trap.h for correct extern functions and variable declarations

lib/sh/zread.c
	- zread: if executing a builtin, call check_signals_and_traps() for
	  backwards compatibility.  If not, call check_signals() only, because
	  we don't want to run traps during, for instance, reading command
	  substitution output.  Fixes race condition bug reported by Luiz Angelo
	  Daros de Luca <luizluca@gmail.com>

				   9/30
				   ----
subst.c
	- command_substitute: reset parse_and_execute_level to 0 in the child
	  process, since it's independent of the other parse_and_execute
	  calls.  Adds command substitution inside other parse_and_execute
	  calls optimizations to suppress forks, as suggested by
	  Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

				   10/3
				   ----
configure.ac
	- SHOBJ_STATUS: make sure it defaults to unsupported and is substituted
	  if the shobj-conf script isn't run.  Fixes `make install' bug with
	  a minimal config reported by Andrew Tomazos <andrewtomazos@gmail.com>

				   10/5
				   ----
support/shobj-conf
	- darwin: set compatibility_version for a shared build of the readline
	  library (the standalone readline distribution shares this file) to
	  $(SHLIB_MAJOR)$(SHLIB_MINOR).  Recommendation from Max Horn
	  <max@quendi.de>

				   10/6
				   ----
array.h
	- array_first_index: new convenience define

array.c
	- ADD_AFTER: new define, complement of ADD_BEFORE
	- UNSET_LASTREF: now takes an array as an argument, prepping for move
	  of lastref pointer into the array struct
	- array_insert: check whether we are adding at the beginning of the
	  array and take a fast path if so
	- array_insert: use same strategy as array_reference to find the place
	  to insert, starting from the last-referenced element and moving
	  forward or back from there; use ADD_AFTER if moving backward
	- array_insert: if replacing an existing element, just replace the
	  value with new->value instead of the entire element
	- array_reference: short-circuit quickly if looking for an element
	  before the first assigned index
	- array_reference: if we don't find the element, leave lastref pointing
	  to the closest element under the assumption we will be assigning or
	  looking for something close
	- array_reference: take advantage of ordered indexes to short-circuit
	  when looking for element that is not set

				   10/7
				   ----
array.c
	- array_remove: short-circuit if asked to remove index after max
	  index or before first index

				   10/10
				   -----
lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- internal_realloc: if we are requesting reallocation to the same size
	  as the block's current size, short-circuit and return `mem' right
	  after doing bounds check
	- internal_realloc: if we are reducing the size of an allocation, and
	  the new size fits in the next lower bin, just keep the same block
	  and adjust the size, so we can avoid some copies

parse.y
	- set_line_mbstate: keep track of the allocated size of
	  shell_input_line_property, only request reallocation if the size
	  increases, but don't let it get too big

				   10/11
				   -----
jobs.c
	- wait_for_background_pids: make sure we wait for pid in
	  last_procsub_child since it's not found in any job -- still needs
	  more work to wait for multiple process substitutions

subst.c
	- process_substitute: if make_child fails, make sure we call
	  restore_pipeline to undo the previous save_pipeline()

				   10/15
				   -----
subst.c
	- process_substitute,command_substitute: leave subshell_level (reflected
	  as $BASH_SUBSHELL) intact for any exit trap instead of decrementing
	  it.  Suggested by Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

builtins/evalstring.c
	- optimize_subshell_command: new function, framework for optimizing
	  out forks for command that have already forked and are executing
	  in a subshell. Not used yet

expr.c
	- readtok: if we have a post-increment or post-decrement, and the
	  previous token is not a string, check whether the previous token is
	  a number that results from a pre-increment or pre-decrement, and
	  make that an error.  Report from Conrad Hoffmann <ch@bitfehler.net>

				   10/16
				   -----
aclocal.m4
	- BASH_JOB_CONTROL_MISSING: convert from AC_TRY_RUN to AC_TRY_COMPILE
	  with existing set of preprocessor defines, so it can work when
	  cross-compiling.  Suggested by Felix Janda <felix.janda@posteo.de>

				   10/19
				   -----
variables.c
	- get_bashpid: BASHPID is no longer readonly; assignments to it are
	  just ignored.

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- BASHPID: note that assignments are ignored and unsetting BASHPID
	  causes it to lose its special properties

				   10/28
				   -----
builtins/pushd.def
	- popd_builtin: make sure to check the normalized stack offset
	  (i.e., negatives counting back from the end of the stack) is within
	  bounds before trying to free that stack entry.  Report from
	  Fernando Muñoz <fernando@null-life.com>

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- chown: protect calls with HAVE_CHOWN.  Fixes for MinGW{64,32} from
	  J. Peter Mugaas <jpmugaas@suddenlink.net>

lib/readline/colors.c
	- S_ISDIR: add define if missing
	- S_ISUID, S_ISGID, S_ISLNK, S_ISSOCK: don't use unless defined.
	  Fixes for MinGW{64,32} from J. Peter Mugaas <jpmugaas@suddenlink.net>

bashhist.c
	- current_command_line_comment: set to the most recent line in a
	  possibly multi-line command that contains a shell comment; set in
	  maybe_add_history and bash_add_history to either the current
	  command number or -2
	- maybe_add_history: set current_command_line_comment for first line
	  of command
	- bash_add_history: chars_to_add set to "\n" if the current command line
	  is one greater than the previous line containing a comment
	  (current_command_line_comment).  Fixes complaint from back in
	  January, 2016 from Dave Rutherford <dave@evilpettingzoo.com>

array.h
	- lastref: move last-referenced pointer into each array struct, so all
	  arrays can have reference locality

array.c
	- array_create: set lastref element to 0
	- array_copy: if copying the lastref in array a, set the new lastref
	  in the copy to the same element
	- IS_LASTREF, LASTREF_START, LASTREF, INVALIDATE_LASTREF, SET_LASTREF,
	  UNSET_LASTREF: change to use new array `lastref' member

pathexp.c
	- quote_string_for_globbing: if quoting for a regexp, make sure to
	  skip and copy a leading `^' in a bracket expression, and skip and
	  copy a subsequent `]' (after an optional `^'), so that leading
	  bracket doesn't close the bracket expression.  Report from
	  Stephane Chazelas <stephane.chazelas@gmail.com>

				   10/29
				   -----
subst.c
	- extract_delimited_string: add calls to CHECK_STRING_OVERRUN for
	  $( inside $((, nested OPENERs, nested ALT_OPENERs, and backquotes
	- skip_to_delim: add calls to CHECK_STRING_OVERRUN for $(, ${,
	  process substitution
	- extract_dollar_brace_string: add calls to CHECK_STRING_OVERRUN for
	  $(
	- extract_dollar_brace_string: use skipsubscript to skip over the
	  array subscript in ${var[sub]} (non-quoted case uses string_extract,
	  which already uses skipsubscript).  Tagged for bash-5.0

				   10/30
				   -----
variables.c
	- EPOCHSECONDS: new dynamic variable, time in seconds since Unix
	  epoch; assignments are ignored.  Can be used on systems where
	  strftime() doesn't support '%s'
	- EPOCHREALTIME: new dynamic variable, time in seconds since Unix
	  epoch with microsecond granularity

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- EPOCHSECONDS documentation
	- EPOCHREALTIME documentation

execute_cmd.c
	- decpoint: moved to locale.c, renamed locale_decpoint; changed callers

{bashintl,externs}.h
	- locale_decpoint: extern declaration or #define if support for
	  localeconv() not there

				   10/31
				   -----
lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- posix_memalign: add new posix-mandated interface

examples/loadables/rm.c
	- rm: minimal loadable builtin, removes files and directories, only
	  handles -r and -f options.  Original from Tim Ruehsen
	  <tim.ruehsen@gmx.de>, heavily rewritten for inclusion as loadable

examples/loadables/Makefile.in
	- rm: add rules to build rm as one of the `other' targets

examples/loadables/stat.c
	- stat: new loadable builtin that takes a filename and loads the info
	  returned by stat(2) into an associative array specified by the -A
	  argument (default STAT)

				   11/1
				   ----
variables.c
	- BASH_ARGV0: new dynamic variable, returns $0 on reference and sets
	  $0 on assignment.  From a suggestion from  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>
	  a few years ago

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- BASH_ARGV0: document

				   11/2
				   ----
lib/glob/sm_loop.c
	- parse_collsym: make sure to not return an out-of-bounds read if a
	  collating symbol is unterminated.  Fixes OOB read reported by
	  Jerzy Kramarz <op7ica@gmail.com>
	- brackmatch: after incrementing p, before checking whether it's a
	  character range, check whether *p was NULL before the increment
	  and short-circuit the bracket expression if it is

jobs.c
	- discard_last_procsub_child: new function, safely discards
	  last_procsub_child and sets it to NULL

subst.c
	- process_substitute: call discard_last_procsub_child instead of
	  calling discard_pipeline directly.  Fixes bug reported by
	  Christian Weisgerber <naddy@mips.inka.de>

				   11/3
				   ----
shell.h
	- EX_DISKFALLBACK: new special return status available to builtins;
	  means to attempt to execute a disk command with the same name as
	  the builtin

examples/loadables/rm.c
	- if we see the -i option, return EX_DISKFALLBACK

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_simple_command: if executing a builtin returns EX_DISKFALLBACK,
	  try running execute_disk_command instead 

bashline.c
	- shell_expand_line: use expand_word to expand the readline line
	  buffer, which allows us to pass flags with the word. If a numeric
	  argument is supplied, do not perform quote removal (pass
	  Q_HERE_DOCUMENT since here-doc quoting does the right thing) and
	  do not perform command or process subsitution.  From a suggestion
	  by Dabrien 'Dabe' Murphy <dabe@dabe.com> based on an old bug-bash
	  discussion

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: note that we have added a quoted IFS char to
	  istring by setting sentinel has_quoted_ifs.  Usually we only add
	  one if we are not going to be performing word splitting, but we
	  will not perform word splitting if there's no expansion, so we need
	  to take care of that case
	- expand_word_internal: when performing final word split, if there are
	  no expansions but has_quoted_ifs is non-zero, call remove_quoted_ifs()
	  to remove any quoted ifs characters we added while processing
	- remove_quoted_ifs: new function, removes CTLESC chars preceding
	  (single-byte) chars in IFS. Used when we are not performing word
	  splitting.  Fixes bug reported by Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

				   11/4
				   ----
lib/readline/macro.c
	- _rl_peek_macro_key: return the next character from the current
	  keyboard macro; the next character from the `next' keyboard macro,
	  if there is one, if at the end of the current macro; or 0 to
	  indicate that we are at the end of a keyboard macro sequence

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- _rl_peek_macro_key: extern declaration

lib/readline/readline.c
	- _rl_dispatch_subseq: add test for ESC at the end of a keyboard macro,
	  which should cause the keyboard timeout for ESC to kick in.  The
	  previous test didn't run the timeout code if executing from a macro,
	  even if we had read the last character of the macro.  Fixes bug
	  reported by Clark Wang <clarkw@vmware.com>

lib/glob/sm_loop.c
	- GMATCH: allow trailing backslash in pattern to explicitly match a
	  backslash that is the last character in the string.  Bug report from
	  Stephane Chazelas <stephane.chazelas@gmail.com>

				   11/5
				   ----
builtins/common.c
	- display_signal_list: if displaying a signal name corresponding to an
	  exit status > 128, don't display the SIG prefix at all.  Old code
	  made displaying the SIG prefix dependent on JOB_CONTROL define.
	  Report and fix from Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_subshell_builtin_or_function: call without_job_control even
	  if JOB_CONTROL is not defined. Similar to fix from 9/23.
	  Report from Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_simple_command: free memory allocated and passed to
	  make_child in the child process if JOB_CONTROL is defined
	- execute_command_internal: free memory allocated and passed to
	  make_child in the child process created to run a () subshell or a
	  compound command within a pipeline if JOB_CONTROL is defined
	- execute_coproc: free memory allocated and passed to make_child in
	  the child process if JOB_CONTROL is defined
	- execute_disk_command: free memory allocated and passed to
	  make_child in the child process if JOB_CONTROL is defined.  This
	  series of fixes is the result of reports from
	  Eduardo A. Bustamante López <dualbus@gmail.com>

				   11/6
				   ----
lib/sh/unicode.c
	- u32toutf16: fix to prevent outputting broken surrogate pairs for
	  Japanese locales (ja_JP.UTF-8) on cygwin (which uses UTF-16 natively).
	  Report and fix from Koichi MURASE <myoga.murase@gmail.com>

builtins/trap.def
	- trap_builtin: if OP is `-' (revert), set the SIGINT signal handler
	  to sigint_sighandler if the shell is interactive and sourcing a
	  file (interactive_shell && sourcelevel) or running a trap
	  (interactive_shell && running_trap) even if it's not currently
	  interactive.  Report from Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

builtins/read.def
	- check for and read multibyte characters in all cases, not just when
	  we are reading a specific number of characters, as long as
	  mb_cur_max > 1

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: some improvements to code that converts istring
	  into a WORD_LIST * to avoid multiple allocations and copies of
	  istring, which is already malloc'ed memory -- reduce number of malloc
	  and free calls

test.c
	- unary_test: make sure if we test -v array[@] or array[*] that we
	  free the return value from array_value

				   11/8
				   ----
expr.c
	- expcond: make sure to set `noeval' before reading tokens depending on
	  the result of the conditional test, since readtok() can evaluate
	  identifiers (and recursively those containing expressions).  Report
	  and fix from Koichi MURASE <myoga.murase@gmail.com>

builtins/evalstring.c
	- should_suppress_fork: make sure to check for traps on EXIT and
	  ERR, since any_signals_trapped() only checks for `real' signals,
	  not the fake shell ones.  Fixes bug reported by Werner Fink
	  <werner@suse.de>
	- optimize_subshell_command: ditto

				   11/9
				   ----
eval.c
	- reader_loop: change so that we don't reset the SIGINT handler every
	  time through the command loop in an interactive shell if the signal
	  is trapped (as the comment noted).  Reported by Report from Martijn
	  Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

subst.c
	- parameter_brace_{patsub,remove_pattern,transform,casemod}: save and
	  restore this_command_name while temporarily setting it for use in
	  error messages.  Fixes use-after-free error reported by
	  Jerzy Kramarz <op7ica@gmail.com>
	- string_extract_verbatim: make sure when we increment i by 2 due to
	  a CTLESC or CTLESC-CTLNUL that we don't read past the end of the
	  string. This can happen if the string ends with an odd number of
	  CTLESC chars. Fixes oob-read error reported by
	  Jerzy Kramarz <op7ica@gmail.com>

				   11/11
				   -----
configure.ac,aclocal.m4
	- BASH_FUNC_SBRK: make sure sbrk actually works, instead of being just
	  a stub function like on several Linux distributions

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- malloc_usable_size: return the maximum number of bytes available for
	  a particular memory allocation (size of block allocated for it)

				   11/12
				   -----
configure.ac
	- changes to make --enable-profiling work on Linux (-pg, no static link,
	  no -static in LDFLAGS)

Makefile.in
	- changes to make --enable-profiling work on Linux (take
	  ${PROFILE_FLAGS} out of  BASE_CCFLAGS, add to CCFLAGS instead; add
	  BASE_LDFLAGS define that doesn't include -pg or -static; use
	  BASE_LDFLAGS in LDFLAGS; move ${PROFILE_FLAGS} and ${STATIC_LD} to

	- changes to make profiling test suite with gprof work on Linux (set
	  GMON_OUT_PREFIX to handle multiple profiled processes per test;
	  change default filename to gmon.out from bash.gmon; look for
	  gprof output files in ${TMPDIR} instead of /tmp; handle multiple

locale.c
	- locale_isutf8: use locale_charset() if it's available and nl_langinfo
	  isn't
	- locale_isutf8: add code to parse a locale specification and determine
	  whether the encoding is UTF-8 (or utf8) in the absence of
	  nl_langinfo and locale_charset
	- set_default_locale: make sure to set locale_utf8locale early on

lib/readline/display.c
	- rl_redisplay: handle report of potential integer overflow in

lib/sh/mbschr.c
	- mbschr: if in a UTF-8 locale (locale_utf8locale) and we are looking
	  for an ASCII character, use (essentially) strchr as a shortcut

lib/sh/shmbchar.c
	- utf8_{mbstrlen,mblen,mbsmbchar,mbsnlen}: UTF-8-specific replacement
	  functions (should also be able to use utf8_mblen in subst.c:
	  string_extract_verbatim)
	- mbsmbchar: if locale_utf8locale is true, call utf8_mbsmbchar
	- mbsmbchar: in UTF-8 locale, use utf8_mblen instead of mbrlen (not
	  used if earlier shortcut taken)

lib/sh/unicode.c
	- u32cconv: don't use nl_langinfo early to call u32toutf8()
	- u32cconv: use locale_utf8locale to set utf8locale
	- u32cconv: when initializing (u32init == 0), use locale_charset, then
	  nl_langinfo, then stub_charset to determine the charset
	- u32cconv: even if we don't have iconv, if locale_utf8locale is non-

lib/readiline/rlprivate.h
	- _rl_init_locale: new extern declaration

lib/readline/readline.c
	- rl_initialize: if not initializing everything the first time, call
	  _rl_init_locale to check current locale and set _rl_utf8locale

lib/readline/text.c
	- _rl_insert_char: optimize cases where we are inserting a single-byte
	  character in a locale with multibyte characters
	- _rl_insert_char: check whether character is single byte if we know
	  we are in a UTF-8 locale, optimize single-byte case to avoid calls
	  to mbrtowc and memmove/memcpy

lib/readline/mbutil.c
	- _rl_char_value: if we are in a UTF-8 locale (_rl_utf8locale) and the
	  current character does not have the eighth bit set ((c & 0x80) == 0),
	  return that char without bothering to call mbrtowc
	- _rl_adjust_point: don't bother calling mbrlen if we are in a UTF-8
	  locale and the current character is not a multibyte character
	- _rl_find_next_mbchar_internal: if we are in a UTF-8 locale, use that

lib/readline/histsearch.c
	- history_search_internal: now takes a `flags' argument instead of just
	  an `anchored' argument to accommodate PATTERN_SEARCH
	- _hs_history_patsearch: new internal interface to use when flags
	  specify PATTERN_SEARCH

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- SF_PATTERN: new flag for non-incremental search contexts, means to
	  treat search string as a pattern (maps to PATTERN_SEARCH)

lib/readline/search.c
	- noninc_dosearch: takes an additional `flags' argument for SF_PATTERN
	- noninc_search_from_pos: takes an additional `flags' argument for
	  SF_PATTERN
	- noninc_dosearch: pass flags argument through to noninc_search_from_pos
	- _rl_nsearch_init: if we are in vi command mode, and `pchar' (key used
	  to invoke the search) is `?' or `/', add SF_PATTERN to the flags
	  to conform to Posix spec for vi-mode editing
	- _rl_nsearch_dosearch: if cxt->sflags indicates that we should do a
	  pattern search, pass SF_PATTERN to noninc_search_from_pos
	- rl_noninc_forward_search_again: if in vi command mode and key == `N',
	  make sure flags arg passed to noninc_dosearch includes SF_PATTERN
	- rl_noninc_reverse_search_again: if in vi command mode and key == `n',

	- rl_history_search_internal: pass newcol pointer to
	  noninc_search_from_pos to avoid having to recompute the match offset
	  in the matching history entry

config.h.in
	- define HAVE_FNMATCH if we have the fnmatch function (configure was
	  already checking for it)

lib/readline/histsearch.c
	- _hs_history_patsearch: transform the pattern into one ending in a
	  `*' to avoid having to perform multiple match attempts from each
	  index in the history line
	- history_search_internal: changes to handle pattern matching if
	  PATTERN_SEARCH is in the flags and HAVE_FNMATCH is defined.  This

	- command_substitute: pass through flags argument to read_comsub
	- read_comsub: now takes additional new flags argument to indicate
	  whether or not the word is in a context where word splitting will
	  eventually be performed
	- read_comsub: if we are running in a context where word splitting
	  will not take place (PF_ASSIGNRHS), we read a CTLESC, and CTLESC is
	  in $IFS, add a CTLESC to make sure it gets through a round of
	  dequoting

bashhist.h

flags.[ch]
	- histexp_flag: new variable, this is what set -H/set -o histexpand
	  sets; history_expansion set to value of this variable; defaults to 0
	- history_expansion: now set to HISTEXPAND_DEFAULT

bashhist.c
	- bash_history_reinit: if interact == 0, set history_expansion to the
	  value of histexp_flag, to allow -H option to enable history
	  expansion
	- bash_history_reinit: if interact == 0, make sure
	  history_expansion_inhibited is set opposite of histexp_flag, so
	  enabling history expansion with -H invocation option turns off
	  inhibited expansion. If interactive shell, we turn it off so
	  history_expansion controls whether or not history expansion takes
	  place. In practice, this function is always called with interact == 0,
	  and -c command still doesn't perform history expansion

shell.c
	- init_interactive: make sure histexp_flag and history_expansion are
	  identical in an interactive shell; allows both -H/+H option and
	  default compilation options (HISTEXPAND_DEFAULT) to work

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: if we're expanding a quoted string containing

	  we're expanding an array subscript (Q_ARRAYSUB), not if we're
	  expanding any arithmetic expression (Q_ARITH).  This fixes a
	  backwards compatibility issue with expressions like ~0 reported by

subst.c
	- parameter_brace_expand_indir: if the variable is not special and
	  the indirect variable is unset (!variable where variable is unset),

	- _rl_get_char_len: look at at most MB_CUR_MAX characters, but maybe
	  fewer if the length of the string is less

builtins/bind.def
	- unbind_keyseq: new function for the -r option; checks whether the
	  key sequence is actually bound before trying to bind it to NULL.
	  Partial fix for https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?109329

parse.y
	- augment `error yacc_EOF' production to call YYABORT in non-interactive
	  shells or calls to parse_and_execute (eval, command substitution,
	  etc.) Fixes bug reported by Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

				   ----
bashline.c
	- edit_and_execute_command: don't add rl_line_buffer to the history
	  list if it's empty; consistent with how other code treats an empty
	  line

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_builtin: make sure to preserve the temporary env across the
	  execution of the `read' builtin or `fc' builtin if HISTORY is
	  defined, in case `read -e' calls edit-and-execute-command.  Should
	  have no side effects. Reported by Eduardo Bustamante
	  <dualbus@gmail.com>

general.c
	- line_isblank: new function: returns true if passed string is composed
	  entirely of blanks

general.h
	- line_isblank: new extern declaration

parse.y
	- history_delimiting_chars: return "" for a blank line, since there's
	  nothing to delimit with `;'

jobs.c
	- wait_for: make sure to call restore_sigint_handler before returning
	  if we return out of the loop due to no children. Report from
	  Eduardo Bustamante <dualbus@gmail.com>

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: if split_on_spaces is set, and the word is
	  unquoted, and IFS is null, split the results of the previous steps
	  on $' \t\n' instead of just ' '. This relies on the previous steps
	  quoting the portions of the word that should not be split.  Fixes
	  bug reported by Kevin Brodsky <corax26@gmail.com>

expr.c
	- evalexp: after running expr_unwind, make sure we reset expr_depth
	  to 0 for the next call
	- expr_streval: if after a call to get_array_value (which can call
	  the expression evaluator recursively) we discover that expr_depth
	  is less than it was before we called it, we assume there has been
	  some kind of error and an expr_unwind, so we treat it as an
	  error and either longjmp back to the expression top level or return
	  0 immediately. Fixes bug reported by Eduardo Bustamante
	  <dualbus@gmail.com>

general.[ch]
	- default_columns: new function, returns the value of COLUMNS, or
	  refreshes it if check_window_size is set and COLUMNS is unset. By
	  default, it returns 80

execute_cmd.c
	- select_query: use default_columns() instead of fetching value of
	  COLUMNS directly

builtins/help.def
	- show_builtin_command_help: use default_columns() instead of fetching
	  value of COLUMNS directly

builtins/read.def
	- read_builtin: call QUIT during the read loop, just in case we get a
	  signal we should act on that didn't cause read to be interrupted.
	  Fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466737
	- read_builtin: if -n or -N is supplied with a 0 argument, try a zero-
	  length read to detect errors and return failure if that read returns
	  a value < 0. Suggested by dualbus@gmail.com

				    7/4
				    ---
bashhist.c
	- maybe_add_history: keep track of whether the current line is a shell
	  comment, even if we're not adding it because it's in a multi-line
	  command, so we use appropriate delimiters between it and any
	  subsequent lines. Fixes bug reported by Grisha Levit
	  <grishalevit@gmail.com> back on 2/28/2017

bashline.c
	- operate_and_get_next: if given an explicit argument, use that to
	  choose which line in the history to use.

lib/readline/doc/rluser.texi,doc/bash.1
	- operate-and-get-next: document new effect of explicit numeric arg

lib/readline/complete.c

builtins/printf.def
	- PRETURN,printf_builtin: check variable returned by bind_printf_variable,

	  because the variable is marked readonly or noassign. Fixes bug
	  reported by Arnaud Gaillard <arnaud.mgaillard@gmail.com>

				    ---
lib/readline/text.c
	- rl_quoted_insert: new feature: a negative argument means to insert
	  the next -COUNT characters using quoted-insert. Original feature
	  from Jason Hood <jadoxa@yahoo.com.au>. Still needs work on
	  redisplay
	- _rl_insert_next_callback: implement support for negative arguments
	  similar to rl_quoted_insert: we just insert one at a time and keep
	  increasing the count until it hits 0

lib/readline/misc.c
	- _rl_arg_callback: if the return value from _rl_arg_dispatch indicates
	  we should keep reading a numeric argument, update the message with
	  the new arg value

				    7/8
				    ---
lib/readline/signals.c
	- _rl_handle_signal: make sure all uses of any of the job control
	  signals are protected by a check for SIGTSTP being defined.  Report
	  from Juan Manuel Guerrero <juan.guerrero@gmx.de>

				   7/11
				   ----
lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- rl_vi_replace: when making the new keymap for vi replacement mode,
	  make sure that ANYOTHERKEY is set correctly, otherwise some input
	  will cause _rl_dispatch to return -2 to the top level.  Fixes fuzzing
	  bug reported by Ben Wong <benjamin.a.wong@gmail.com>

				   7/19
				   ----
builtins/read.def
	- struct ttsave: make the attrs member a struct, not a pointer, to force
	  a structure copy that will survive a longjmp to another context.
	  Leaving it as a pointer to a local struct is not portable

				   9/10
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- execute_builtin: make sure that we set up the unwind-protect for
	  pop_scope (temporary_env is non-zero) so that the temporary env
	  is propagated to the current environment only for special builtins
	  (source/eval/unset) not run by the command builtin
	  (flags & CMD_COMMAND_BUILTIN == 0).  Fixes bug reported by
	  Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

				   9/17
				   ----
builtins/printf.def
	- asciicode: don't use mblen to check whether or not a character is a

{jobs,subst}.h
	- move declaration of last_command_subst_pid to subst.h, since it's
	  declared in subst.c and doesn't depend on job control. Reported by
	  Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

builtins/read.def,variables.c
	- fixed a couple of problems (READLINE, ARRAY_VARS) that prevented
	  the minimal config from building

				   10/1
				   ----
parse.y
	- special_case_tokens: if we are returning DO in a case where the last
	  two tokens read are `FOR' and `WORD' make sure we decrement
	  expecting_in_token.  Fixes bug reported by Martijn Dekker
	  <martijn@inlv.org>

				   ----
subst.c
	- expand_string_for_rhs: now takes an additional PFLAGS argument from
	  its caller (one so far); passes that through to call_expand_word_internal
	  as W_ASSIGNRHS. Fixes bug reported by Martijn Dekker
	  <martijn@inlv.org>
	- expand_string_for_rhs: expanding b in ${a[:]=b} is now done as if
	  b were the rhs of an assignment statement. This means that splitting
	  isn't done, but tilde expansion is performed as if the statement
	  were `a=b'. Fixes splitting bug with $* reported by Martijn Dekker
	  <martijn@inlv.org>

command.h
	- W_NOASSNTILDE: new word flag, means to not perform tilde expansion
	  following a `:' even if the word has the W_ASSIGNRHS flag enabled

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: if we see a `:' with the W_NOASSNTILDE flag
	  set, just add the character and inhibit any subsequent tilde
	  expansion. Currently not set anywhere, but it could be set in
	  expand_string_for_rhs to satisfy its peculiar semantics

				   -----
subst.c
	- expand_string_for_rhs: set W_NOASSNTILDE if the operator is `='
	  for backwards compatibility with bash-4.4

shell.c
	- main: set positional parameters before running the startup files,
	  so the startup files can inspect $@.  Often-requested feature,
	  most recently from Stephane Chazelas <stephane.chazelas@gmail.com>

				   10/27
				   -----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- Arrays: add some clarifying language to make it clear that array
	  references that don't use the ${a[s]} syntax are subject to
	  globbing when passed as arguments to commands such as unset, and
	  should be quoted for safety. Change prompted by a report from
	  Eli Barzilay <eli@barzilay.org>

parse.y
	- parse_comsub: make sure we don't run off the end of the `ret'
	  buffer when checking for the here doc delimiter.  Report from

builtins/pushd.def
	- get_directory_stack: make sure the current directory (element 0 of
	  the stack) is passed to polite_directory_format under the same
	  conditions as the rest of the stack entries (flags & 1). Otherwise
	  something like `cd ${DIRSTACK[0]}' will fail. Fixes bug reported
	  by Steve Jones <sjml@slohj.org>

builtins/declare.def
	- declare_internal: when checking for a `[' to see whether or not this
	  is an array variable declaration (declare -a foo[12]), make sure
	  we don't do the check if we're just dealing with shell functions.
	  Bug and pointer to fix from PJ Eby <pje@telecommunity.com>

				   11/1
				   ----
parse.y
	- parse_comsub: if we read a four-character word followed by a break
	  character, and that word is not one of the reserved words, set
	  lex_rwlen to 0 since we are no longer in a reserved word. It only
	  hurts if another break character immediately follows, so that test
	  succeeds again. Turn off the RESWDOK flag only if it's not a shell
	  metacharacter, too. Fixes bug reported by Kjetil Torgrim Homme
	  <kjetilho@scribus.ms.redpill-linpro.com>

lib/readline/isearch.c
	- _rl_isearch_dispatch: if we are searching in reverse order, let
	  sline_index go to -1 to avoid searching the same line twice. It
	  gets reset right after that, so there's no danger of indexing into
	  the history line with a negative index.

subst.c
	- do_assignment_internal: if performing a compound assignment, make
	  sure to pass ASS_CHKLOCAL flag to do_compound_assignment if the
	  assignment word has the W_CHKLOCAL flag set
	- do_compound_assignment: honor ASS_CHKLOCAL flag and check for an
	  existing local variable before creating or modifying a global
	  variable

builtins/declare.def
	- declare_internal: new (undocumented so far) option: -G. Means to
	  act on global variables (create, modify) if no local variable is
	  found with the specified name
	- declare_find_variable: new declare-specific wrapper functon for
	  declare builtin; obeys -g and -G options in one place
	- declare_internal: if no variable is found after following any nameref
	  chain, look up the variable using declare_find_variable to honor the
	  -G option. XXX - so far, this is the only place that function is used

subst.c
	- shell_expand_word_list: before calling make_internal_declare, add
	  'G' to the options list if W_CHKLOCAL is set in the word's flags.
	  This makes builtins like `readonly' that modify local variables in
	  a function behave the same for scalar and array variables

parse.y
	- shell_getc: move code that decides whether to append a space to an

parse.y
	- clear_string_list_expander: take a pointer to an alias that's about
	  to be freed and make sure there aren't any pointers to it in the
	  list of pushed strings. If there are, zero it out in the pushed
	  string list to avoid referencing freed memory in pop_string()

alias.c

pcomplib.c

	  feature

pcomplete.h
	- COPT_LASTUSER: last flag value used by user-settable completion
	  options
	- PCOMP_RETRYFAIL, PCOMP_NOTFOUND: new #defines, possible return values
	  from programmable_completions in FOUNDP argument. Moved RETRYFAIL
	  define here from pcomplete.c to avoid collisions with user-settable
	  option values (COPT_*)

				   1/15
				   ----
pcomplete.c
	- programmable_completions: if we don't find any completions for a
	  command, and RETRY is 0, see if the command is a defined alias,
	  expand it, and try to expand the first word of the value as a
	  command, and find any programmable completions for it. Here right
	  now, could be moved to attempt_shell_completion later if we need
	  to do more analysis of the expanded line. We'll see how it works
	  in practice. (Disabled for now.)

parse.y
	- grammar: when timing the null command, make sure to turn off the

	  names case-insensitively if the readline completion-ignore-case
	  variable is set. Inspired by report from <odnehel@gmail.com>

lib/readline/display.c
	- update_line: when performing a dumb update after wrapping the line
	  (usually due to printing the prompt), make sure we adjust
	  _rl_last_c_pos if there are invisible characters in prompt lines
	  other than the first (we assume those invisible characters are in
	  the last line, which is nearly always the case). We adjust by the
	  total number of invisible chars less the number of invisible chars
	  in the first prompt line. From a report in

jobs.c
	- add sentinel to wait_sigint_handler so it only sets wait_sigint_received

	  SIGINT handler and sends itself the SIGINT
	- set waiting_for_child around the calls to waitchld that use it to
	  synchronously wait for a process
	- change logic that decides whether or not the child process blocked
	  or handled SIGINT based on whether or not waitpid returns -1/EINTR
	  and the shell receives a SIGINT and the child does not exit.  If
	  the child later exits due to SIGINT, cancel the assumoption that it
	  was handled
	- instead of testing whether or not the child exited due to SIGINT
	  when deciding whether the shell should act on a SIGINT it received
	  while waiting, test whether or not we think the child caught
	  SIGINT.  If it did, we let it go (unless the shell has it trapped);

	- call rl_event_hook, if it's set, if call to read in rl_getc
	  returns -1/EINTR.  If rl_event_hook doesn't do anything, this
	  continues the loop as before.  This handles the other fatal
	  signals

execute_cmd.c
	- add a couple of QUIT; calls to execute_disk_command and
	  execute_simple_command to improve responsiveness to interrupts
	  and fatal signals

input.c
	- rearrange getc_with_restart so that the return values from read()
	  are handled right

parse.y
	- don't need to set terminate_immediately in yy_stream_get, since
	  getc_with_restart checks for terminating signals itself
	- since readline returns READERR on SIGHUP or SIGTERM, don't need

	  signals well -- will have to check that some more

bashline.c

	  implementation of exponentiation by squaring.  Inspired by report
	  from Nicolas ARGYROU <nargy@yahoo.com>

bashline.c
	- bash_quote_filename: check for rtext being non-null before
	  dereferencing it
	- set_saved_history: operate_and_get_next assumes that the previous
	  line was added to the history, even when the history is stifled and
	  at the max number of entries.  If it wasn't, make sure the history
	  number is incremented properly.  Partial fix for bug reported by
	  gregrwm <backuppc-users@whitleymott.net>

bashhist.c
	- maybe_add_history: act as if literal_history is set when parser_state
	  includes PST_HEREDOC, so we save the bodies of here-documents just
	  as they were entered.  Fixes bug reported by Jonathan Wakely
	  <bugs@kayari.org>
	- bash_add_history: make sure that the second and subsequent lines of
	  a here document don't have extra newlines or other delimiting
	  chars added, since they have the trailing newline preserved, when
	  `lithist' is set and history_delimiting_chars isn't called

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_command_internal: avoid fd exhaustion caused by using
	  process substitution in loops inside shell functions by using
	  copy_fifo_list and close_new_fifos ().  Fixes debian bash bug
	  642504

lib/readline/complete.c
	- new variable, rl_filename_stat_hook, used by append_to_match.  If
	  filename completion is desired, and rl_filename_stat_hook points
	  to a function, call that function to expand the filename in an
	  application-specific way before calling stat.

bashline.c
	- bash_default_completion: if variable completion returns a single
	  match, use bash_filename_stat_hook and file_isdir to determine
	  whether or not the variable name expands to a directory.  If it
	  does, set the filename_append_character to `/'.  This is not
	  perfect, so we will see how it works out.  Adds functionality
	  requested by Peter Toft <pto@linuxbog.dk> and Patrick Pfeifer
	  <patrick@pfeifer.de>
	- rl_filename_stat_hook: assigned bash_filename_stat_hook, so things
	  like $HOME/Downloads (after completion) have a slash appended.
	  In general, this causes the stat hook to be called whenever
	  filename completion is appended.  Adds functionality requested by
	  Patrick Pfeifer <patrick@pfeifer.de>

lib/readline/readline.h
	- new extern declaration for rl_filename_stat_hook

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texi
	- rl_directory_rewrite_hook: now documented
	- rl_filename_stat_hook: document

pcomplete.c
	- gen_action_completions: in the CA_DIRECTORY case, turn off
	  rl_filename_completion_desired if it was off before we called
	  rl_filename_completion_function and we didn't get any matches.
	  Having it on causes readline to quote the matches as if they
	  were filenames.  Adds functionality requested by many,
	  including Clark Wang <dearvoid@gmail.com>

assoc.[ch]
	- assoc_replace: new function, takes the same arguments as
	  assoc_insert, but returns the old data instead of freeing it
	- assoc_insert: if the object returned by hash_insert doesn't have
	  the same value for its key as the key passed as an argument, we
	  are overwriting an existing value.  In this case, we can free the
	  key.  Fixes bug reported by David Parks <davidparks21@yahoo.com>

print_cmd.c
	- indirection_level_string: small change to only re-enable `x'
	  option after calling decode_prompt_string if it was on before.  In
	  normal mode, it will be, but John Reiser <jreiser@bitwagon.com>
	  has a novel use for that code in conjunction with a pre-loaded
	  shared library that traces system call usage in shell scripts

lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- remove some dependencies on version.h where it doesn't make sense

variables.c
	- initialize_shell_variables: while reading the environment, a shell
	  running in posix mode now checks for SHELLOPTS being readonly (it
	  gets set early on in main()) before trying to assign to it.  It
	  saves an error message and the variable gets parsed as it should.

bashline.c
	- attempt_shell_completion: add call to set_directory_hook() to make
	  sure the rewrite functions are correct.  It's cheap and doesn't
	  hurt
	- command_word_completion_function: if completing a command name that
	  starts with `.' or `..', temporarily suppress the effects of the
	  `direxpand' option and restore the correct value after calling
	  rl_filename_completion_function.  If it's enabled, the directory

	- parameter_brace_patsub: don't need to check for PATSUB being NULL;
	  it never is

flags.c
	- if STRICT_POSIX is defined, initialize history_expansion to 0, since
	  history expansion (and its treatment of ! within double quotes) is
	  not a conforming posix environment.  From austin-group issue 500

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- history_expand: when processing a string within double quotes
	  (DQUOTE == 1), make the closing double quote inhibit history
	  expansion, as if the word were outside double quotes.  In effect,
	  we assume that the double quote is followed by a character in
	  history_no_expand_chars.  tcsh and csh seem to do this.  This
	  answers a persistent complaint about history expansion

				   10/29

make_cmd.c
	- make_arith_for_command: use skip_to_delim to find the next `;'

doc/bash.1,lib/readline/doc/rluser.texi
	- document new -o noquote option to complete/compgen/compopt

pathexp.c
	- quote_string_for_globbing: if QGLOB_REGEXP, make sure characters
	  between brackets in an ERE bracket expression are not inappropriately
	  quoted with backslashes.  This is a pretty substantial change,
	  should be stressed when opening bash up for alpha and beta tests.
	  Fixes bug pointed out by Stephane Chazleas
	  <stephane_chazelas@yahoo.fr>

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document that regexp matches can be inconsistent when quoting
	  characters in bracket expressions, since usual quoting characters
	  lose their meaning within brackets
	- note that regular expression matching when the pattern is stored
	  in a shell variable which is quoted for expansion causes string
	  matching

redir.h
	- RX_SAVEFD: new flag value; notes that a redirection denotes an
	  fd used to save another even if it's not >= SHELL_FD_BASE

redir.c
	- do_redirection_internal: when deciding whether or not to reset the
	  close-on-exec flag on a restored file descriptor, trust the value
	  of redirect->flags & RX_SAVCLEXEC even if the fd is < SHELL_FD_BASE
	  if the RX_SAVEFD flag is set
	- add_undo_redirect: set the RX_SAVEFD flag if the file descriptor
	  limit is such that the shell can't duplicate to a file descriptor
	  >= 10.  Fixes a limitation that tripped a coreutils test reported
	  by Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

lib/readline/input.c
	- rl_read_key: don't need to increment key sequence length here; doing

lib/readline/macro.c
	- rl_end_kbd_macro: after off-by-one error with rl_key_sequence_length
	  fixed, can decrement current_macro_index by rl_key_sequence_length
	  (length of key sequence that closes keyboard macro)

lib/readline/readline.c
	- _rl_dispatch_subseq: fix extra increment of rl_key_sequence_length
	  when ESC maps to a new keymap and we're converting meta characters
	  to ESC+key
	- _rl_dispatch_subseq: better increment of rl_key_sequence_length
	  before we dispatch to a function in the ISFUNC case (where the
	  second increment above should have happened)
	- rl_executing_keyseq: the full key sequence that ended up executing
	  a readline command.  Available to the calling application, maintained

	  statements and flag that point is in a command position so we can
	  do command name completion
	- attempt_shell_completion: if the word being completed is the first

builtins/read.def
	- read_builtin: changes to posix-mode (posixly_correct != 0) to make

lib/readline/complete.c
	- _rl_colored_stats: new variable, controlled by colored-stats bindable

	- print_filename: changes to print colors if `colored-stats' variable
	  set.  Changes contributed by Raphael Droz
	  <raphael.droz+floss@gmail.com>

lib/readline/readline.c

lib/readline/complete.c
	- stat_char: call rl_filename_stat_hook before calling lstat/stat

findcmd.[ch],execute_cmd.c

	- search_for_command: if (flags & 1), put the command found in $PATH
	  into the command hash table (previous default behavior)

execute_cmd.c
	- is_dirname: call search_for_command with flags argument of 0 so it
	  doesn't try to put something in the command hash table

bashline.c
	- bash_command_name_stat_hook: a hook function for readline's
	  filename_stat_hook that does $PATH searching the same way that
	  execute_cmd.c:execute_disk_command() does it, and rewrites the
	  passed filename if found.  Does not put names into command hash
	  table.  This allows command name completion to take advantage
	  of `visible-stats' and `colored-stats' settings.
	- executable_completion: new function, calls the directory completion
	  hook to expand the filename before calling executable_file or
	  executable_or_directory; change command_word_completion_function to
	  call executable_completion.  This allows $HOME/bin/[TAB] to do

	- gen_shell_function_matches: now takes a new second argument: the
	  command that originally caused the completion function to be
	  invoked; changed callers (gen_compspec_completions))
	- build_arg_list: now takes a new second argument: the command name
	  corresponding to the current compspec; changed callers
	  (gen_command_matches, gen_shell_function_matches)
	- build_arg_list: now uses `cmd' argument to create $1 passed to
	  invoked command or shell function
	- gen_compspec_completions: if we skipped a null command at the
	  beginning of the line (e.g., for completing `>'), add a new word for
	  it at the beginning of the word list and increment nw and cw
	  appropriately.  This is all a partial fix for the shortcoming

subst.c

include/stat-time.h
	- new file, cribbed from gnulib, with additions from coreutils: include

	- filecomp: call stat_mtime instead of sh_stat for each filename
	  argument to get the mtime as a struct timespec

	- call run_pending_traps after each call to QUIT or test of
	  interrupt_state, like we do in mainline shell code
	- glob_vector: don't call QUIT; in `if (lose)' code block; just free
	  memory, return NULL, and let callers deal with interrupt_state or
	  other signals and traps

lib/readline/input.c
	- rl_read_key: restructure the loop that calls the event hook a little,
	  so that the hook is called only after rl_gather_tyi returns no input,
	  and any pending input is returned first.  This results in better
	  efficiency for processing pending input without calling the hook
	  on every input character as bash-4.1 did.  From a report from

lib/glob/glob.c
	- glob_vector: check for pending SIGINT trap each time through the loop,
	  just like we check for interrupt_state or terminating_signal, and
	  set `lose = 1' so we clean up after ourselves and interrupt the
	  operation before running the trap.  This may require a change later,
	  maybe call run_pending_traps and do that if run_pending_traps returns?

variables.c
	- sv_histtimefmt: set history_comment_character to default (`#') if
	  it's 0 when we're turning on history timestamps.  The history code
	  uses the history comment character to prefix timestamps, and
	  leaving it at 0 effectively removes them from the history.  From a

lib/readline/complete.c
	- rl_display_match_list: if printing completions horizontally, don't
	  bother with spacing calculations if limit == 1, which means we are
	  printing one completion per line no matter what.  Fixes bug
	  reported by David Kaasen <kaasen@nvg.ntnu.no>

builtins/declare.def
	- declare_internal: add error checking for nameref attribute and
	  variable assignments: self-references, attempts to make an array
	  variable a nameref

subst.c
	- parameter_brace_expand: handle parameter_brace_expand_word returning
	  &expand_param_fatal or &expand_param_error and return the appropriate
	  error value
	- parameter_brace_expand_word: if a nameref variable's value is not a
	  valid identifier, return an error
	- param_expand: if a nameref variable's value is not a valid identifier,
	  return an error

test.c
	- unary_operator: add new -R variable, returns true if variable is set
	  and has the nameref attribute. From ksh93

builtins/test.def
	- add -R to description of conditional commands for help test

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document new -R unary conditional operator

trap.c
	- check_signals_and_traps: new function, convenience function for the
	  rest of the shell to check for pending terminating and interrupt
	  signals, and to check for and process any pending traps
	- any_signals_trapped: new function, returns non-zero if any signals
	  are trapped and -1 if not

trap.h
	- extern declaration for check_signals_and_traps

bashline.c
	- bashline_reset: make sure we reset the event hook
	- bash_event_hook: call check_signals_and_traps instead of just
	  checking for terminating signals so we can run pending traps and
	  react to interrupts, and reset the event hook when we're done


				   10/14
				   -----
trap.c
	- trap_handler: if executing in a readline signal handler context,
	  call bashline_set_event_hook to install bash_event_hook to process
	  the signal (if bash cares about it)

sig.c
	- sigint_sighandler: call bashline_set_event_hook to set the event
	  hook if we're executing in a readline signal handler context

lib/readline/input.c
	- rl_getc: call RL_CHECK_SIGNALS if read returns -1/EINTR and the caught
	  signal is SIGINT or SIGQUIT rather than waiting until the next time
	  around the loop
	- rl_getc: call rl_event_hook after calling RL_CHECK_SIGNALS to allow
	  an application signal handler to set the event hook in its own
	  signal handler (e.g., like bash trap_handler or sigint_sighandler)


parse.y
	- yy_readline_get: don't set interrupt_immediately before we call
	  readline().  Inspired by report from lanshun zhou
	  <zls.sogou@gmail.com>

input.c
	- getc_with_restart: add call to run_pending_traps after call to
	  CHECK_TERMSIG

lib/sh/zread.c
	- zread: call check_signals_and_traps if read() returns -1/EINTR
	  instead of just ignoring the EINTR and deferring handling any
	  signal that generated it

builtins/mapfile.def
	- mapfile: don't set interrupt_immediately before calling zgetline()
	  (which uses zread internally)

builtins/read.def
	- read_builtin: don't set interrupt_immediately before calling zread
	  (moved code around so that it was only being set right around calls
	  to zread to avoid signal handler conflicts).  Inspired by report
	  from lanshun zhou <zls.sogou@gmail.com>
	- edit_line: don't set interrupt_immediately around call to readline()
	- include shmbutil.h

builtins/wait.def
	- WAIT_RETURN: set wait_signal_received back to 0 for the potential
	  next call to wait

quit.h
	- CHECK_WAIT_INTR: macro to check whether trap_handler handled a
	  signal and set wait_signal_received; longjmp to wait_intr_buf in
	  that case

jobs.c
	- wait_for, waitchld: call CHECK_WAIT_INTR at the same places we call
	  CHECK_TERMSIG to check for terminating signals
	- wait_sigint_handler: don't longjmp out of the wait builtin unless
	  interrupt_immediately is set; otherwise just SIGRETURN from the
	  handler
	- wait_sigint_handler: if interrupt_immediately not set, but we are
	  executing in the wait builtin and SIGINT is not trapped, treat it
	  as a `normally received' SIGINT: restore the signal handler and
	  send SIGINT to ourselves
	- waitchld: when in posix mode and running SIGCHLD traps, don't longjmp
	  to wait_intr_buf (and let wait be interrupted) if we're running from
	  a signal handler.  Wait for CHECK_WAIT_INTR to do the longjmp.
	  run_pending_traps will run the SIGCHLD trap later

nojobs.c
	- reap_zombie_children, wait_for_single_pid, wait_for: call
	  CHECK_WAIT_INTR where we call CHECK_TERMSIG
	- wait_sigint_handler: don't longjmp out of the wait builtin unless
	  interrupt_immediately is set; otherwise just SIGRETURN from the
	  handler

trap.c
	- trap_handler: make sure wait_signal_received is set if the wait
	  builtin is executing, and only longjmp if interrupt_immediately is
	  set.  This whole set of fixes was prompted by report from
	  lanshun zhou <zls.sogou@gmail.com>

	- command_substitute: call set_shellopts after turning off errexit
	  in subshells so it's reflected in $SHELLOPTS

				   11/7
				   ----
builtins/evalstring.c
	- parse_and_execute: treat ERREXIT case like reader_loop does: set
	  variable_context to 0 before longjmping back to top_level. Don't
	  run the unwind-protect context to avoid side effects from popping
	  function contexts.  Part of fix for problem reported by Nikolai
	  Kondrashov <nikolai.kondrashov@redhat.com>

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_simple_command: call unlink_fifo_list only if this is the
	  last element of a pipeline (or not in a pipeline), rather than for
	  every child.  Fixes difference in behavior between /dev/fd and
	  FIFOs reported by Zev Weiss <zev@bewilderbeest.net>
	- execute_null_command: do the same thing in the parent branch after
	  make_child

				   11/14
				   -----
subst.c
	- parameter_brace_expand: a variable is null if it's special ($@, $*),
	  the expansion occurs within double quotes, and the expansion turns
	  into a quoted null.  Fixes debian bug 692447 reported by
	  Matrosov Dmitriy <sgf.dma@gmail.com>

jobs.c
	- run_sigchld_trap: make sure `running_trap' sentinel is set
	  appropriately
	- waitchld: only run the sigchld trap if we're not in a signal
	  handler, not running a trap, and executing the wait builtin.
	  Otherwise, queue for later handling.  We still run one instance
	  of the trap handler per exited child.  Bulk of fix for bug
	  reported by Elliott Forney <idfah@cs.colostate.edu>

trap.c
	- queue_sigchld_trap: set catch_flag so run_pending_traps notices,
	  and set trapped_signal_received for completeness.  Rest of fix
	  for bug reported by Elliott Forney <idfah@cs.colostate.edu>

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- block_signals: renamed to _malloc_block_signals, made public

lib/malloc/table.c
	- mregister_alloc, mregister_free: block signals around table
	  manipulation

				   11/15
				   -----
trap.c
	- run_pending_traps: set SIG_INPROGRESS flag around calls to
	  run_sigchld_handler so other parts of the shell know that the
	  SIGCHLD trap handler is executing
	- run_pending_traps: if we get a situation where we are looking at
	  running a SIGCHLD trap but the trap string is IMPOSSIBLE_TRAP_HANDLER
	  and the SIG_INPROGRESS flag is set, just skip it.  This is possible
	  if run_pending_traps is called from a SIGCHLD trap handler run by
	  run_sigchld_trap

doc/bash.1,lib/readline/doc/{rluser.texi,readline.3}

redir.c
	- do_redirection_internal: if we have REDIR_VARASSIGN set in the
	  redirection flags and we set up `redirector' using fcntl or dup2,
	  don't add a redirect to make sure it stays open.  Let the
	  script programmer manage the file handle.  Fixes bug reported by
	  Sam Liddicott <sam@liddicott.com>

				   11/24
				   -----
jobs.c
	- wait_for_any_job: new function, waits for an unspecified background
	  job to exit and returns its exit status.  Returns -1 on no background
	  jobs or no children or other errors.  Calls wait_for with new
	  sentinel value ANY_PID
	- wait_for: changes to handle argument of ANY_PID: don't look up or
	  try to modify the child struct, only go through the wait loop once.
	  Return -1 if waitpid returns no children

jobs.h
	- ANY_PID: new define

builtins/wait.def
	- new option: -n. Means to wait for the next job and return its exit
	  status.  Returns 127 if there are no background jobs (or no

	  <idfah@cs.colostate.edu>

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document new `wait -n' option

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_command_internal: save make_command_string () result in a

builtins/declare.def
	- declare_internal: if an array variable is declared using `declare -a'
	  or `declare -A', but not assigned a value, set the `invisible'
	  attribute so the variable does not show up as set.  Fix for bug
	  about variable initialization reported by Tim Friske <me@timfriske.com>

builtins/{mapfile,read}.def
	- after calling find_or_make_array_variable, make sure the invisible
	  flag is turned off, in case the variable was declared previously
	  using `declare -a' or `declare -A'.  Side effect of above change to
	  declare_internal

subst.c
	- shell_expand_word_list: handle the W_ASSNGLOBAL flag and put -g into

subst.c
	- process_substitute: turn off the `expanding_redir' flag, which
	  controls whether or not variables.c:find_variable_internal uses the
	  temporary environment to find variables.  We want to use the

				   12/10
				   -----
lib/glob/glob.c
	- glob_filename: finish up a series of changes to make globstar-style	
	  globbing more efficient, avoid more duplicate filenames, and be more
	  compatible with other shells that implement it
		o collapse a sequence of **/**/** to one **

	  are in horizontal mode; set to false in horizontal mode if the left
	  margin of the displayed line is greater than the end of the prompt
	  string
	- rl_redisplay: when in horizontal scroll mode, don't adjust
	  _rl_last_c_pos by the wrap offset unless the line is displaying
	  a prompt containing invisible chars
	- update line: don't adjust _rl_last_c_pos by the wrap offset unless

	- update_line: if shrinking the line by reducing the number of
	  displayed characters, but we have already moved the cursor to the
	  beginning of the line where the first difference starts, don't
	  try to delete characters

builtins/read.def
	- unbuffered_read: set to 2 if invoked as `read -N'
	- if unbuffered_read is set to 2, compute the number of chars we

	  uses zreadintr.  Code from Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}

	  López<dualbus@gmail.com>  and Dan Douglas <ormaaj@gmail.com>

braces.c
	- array_concat: don't be so aggressive in trying to short-circuit. We
	  can only short-circuit if we have a single-element array where the
	  element is an empty string (array[0] == "" array[1] = 0x0).  Existing
	  practice requires us to replicate arrays and prefix or append empty
	  strings.  Fixes bug reported by Eduardo A. Bustamante López

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_builtin: since mapfile uses evalstring() to run its callbacks
	  internally, just like eval, so it needs to handle the case where the
	  temp environment given to mapfile persists throughout the entire
	  set of callback commands.  This might be a problem with trap also, but
	  trap isn't run in the same way.  Fixes bug reported by Dan Douglas

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: case '\\': if the next character is an IFS
	  character, and the expansion occurs within double quotes, and the
	  character is not one for which backslash retains its meaning, add
	  the (escaped) '\' and the (escaped) character.  Fixes bug reported

	  Suggested by Dan Douglas <ormaaj@gmail.com> [TENTATIVE, needs work
	  on IFS side effects]

command.h
	- W_GLOBEXP (which was unused) is now W_SPLITSPACE (which isn't used
	  yet)

	- removed all code that mentioned W_GLOBEXP

subst.c
	- param_expand: set W_SPLITSPACE if we expand (unquoted) $* and
	  IFS is unset or null so we can be sure to split this on spaces
	  no matter what happens with IFS later
	- expand_word_internal: note that param_expand returns W_SPLITSPACE

				   ----
subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: if split_on_spaces is non-zero, make sure

	  trap and signal handling and doing away with interrupt_immediately

				   1/26
				   ----
redir.c
	- redirection_expand, write_here_string, write_here_document: before
	  calling any of the word expansion functions, after setting
	  expanding_redir to 1 (which bypasses the temp environment in the
	  variable lookup functions), call sv_ifs to reset the cached IFS-
	  related variables set by subst.c:setifs().  This ensures that
	  redirections will not get any IFS values that are set in the
	  temporary environment, as Posix specifies.  Then, after the word
	  expansions, after resetting expanding_redir to 0, call sv_ifs
	  again to make sure the cached IFS values are set from any
	  assignments in the temporary environment.  We force executing_builtin
	  to 1 to `fool' the variable lookup functions into using any temp
	  environment, then reset it to its old value after sv_ifs returns.
	  This is what allows read() to use the (cached) IFS variables set
	  in the temp environment. Fixes inconsistency reported by Dan Douglas

configure.ac
	- use AC_CHECK_TOOL instead of AC_CHECK_PROG to check for ar, since it
	  will find $host-prefixed versions of utilities.  Report and fix from

builtins/setattr.def
	- set_var_attribute: check whether bind_variable (called when the
	  variable whose attributes are being modified is found in the temp
	  environment) just modified a read-only global variable, and don't
	  bother marking the temporary variable for propagation if so.  The
	  propagation is superfluous and will result in a strange error

variables.c

quit.h
	- move CHECK_ALRM macro here from builtins/read.def so trap.c:
	  check_signals() can call it

trap.c
	- check_signals: add call to CHECK_ALRM before QUIT
	- check_signals_and_traps: call check_signals() instead of including
	  CHECK_ALRM and QUIT inline.  Integrating check for read builtin's

trap.[ch]
	- get_original_signal: now global so rest of the shell can use it

sig.c
	- initialize_shell_signals: install a signal handler for SIGTERM
	  that does nothing except set a sigterm_received flag instead of
	  ignoring it with SIG_IGN, as long as SIGTERM is not ignored when
	  the shell is started.  Use get_original_signal early to get the
	  original handler, since we will do that later anyway
	- set_signal_handler: if installing sigterm_sighandler as the SIGTERM
	  handler, make sure to add SA_RESTART flag to make it as close to
	  SIG_IGN as possible

sig.h
	- sigterm_sighandler: new extern declaration

quit.h

jobs.c
	- make_child: call RESET_SIGTERM just before fork() so we can detect
	  if the child process received a SIGTERM before it's able to change
	  the signal handler back to what it was when the shell started
	  (presumably SIG_DFL).  Only has effect if the shell installed
	  sigterm_sighandler for SIGTERM, interactive shells that were not
	  started with SIG_IGN as the SIGTERM handler
	- make_child: call RESET_SIGTERM in the parent after fork() so the
	  rest of the shell won't react to it

execute_cmd.c

	- update_line: use col_temp instead of recalculating it using

	- update_line: use open_some_spaces and then output the right number
	  of chars instead of trying to print new characters then overwrite

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- morecore,internal_malloc,internal_free: requests for more than
	  128K bytes (defined as MMAP_THRESHOLD and saved in the new
	  malloc_mmap_threshold variable) are now satisfied via mmap and
	  freed via munmap. We only use mmap if we have mmap and MAP_ANON
	  (or MAP_ANONYMOUS). These blocks are not available for splitting
	  or coalescing, so every request for 128K bytes or smaller is
	  satisfied via sbrk(). We don't use mremap for realloc yet, but
	  we could in the future

lib/malloc/mstats.h
	- malloc_stats: the malloc stats now include the number of calls to
	  mmap and the total number of bytes requested via mmap. The number
	  of calls to munmap is captured in each bucket's lesscore count

lib/malloc/stats.c

	  application before calling history_expand to note that the string
	  being expanded is part of a quoted string. Can be set to a single
	  quote, a double quote, or 0 (no quoting)
	- history_expand: look at history_quoting_state and honor the
	  single-quote setting by not expanding any initial portion of the
	  line before the closing single quote. This allows history expansions
	  to be performed on a line containing a closing single quote if they
	  appear after the single quote

	- darwin: changed the install_name embedded into the shared library
	  to contain only the major version number, not the minor one. The
	  idea is that the minor versions should all be API/ABI compatible,
	  and it is better to link automatically with the latest one.  Idea
	  from Max Horn <max@quendi.de>
